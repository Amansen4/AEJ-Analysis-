# AEJ – Grey-Hat Risk Analysis
## Facebook / Meta Platforms

Applied Engineering Judgement (AEJ)  
System-level risk analysis focusing on data power, incentives, and societal impact.

---

## 1. Shadow Profiles (Non-User Data Capture)

**Observation**  
Research and regulatory findings indicate that Meta can store data about non-users through contact syncing, embedded pixels, and third-party integrations.

**Risk Judgement**  
Non-consensual data aggregation enables indirect profiling of individuals who never joined the platform.

**System Risk**
- Identity prediction without consent
- Network-based inference of beliefs and location

**Human Impact**
Loss of privacy even outside the platform.

---

## 2. AI Training & Data Permanence Risk

**Observation**  
Public posts and images may be used to train AI systems. Once data influences model weights, full deletion becomes technically infeasible.

**Risk Judgement**  
User data may achieve functional permanence inside AI systems even after account deletion.

**Human Impact**
Loss of meaningful data control.

---

## 3. Engagement-First Architecture vs Safety

**Observation**  
Multiple academic studies suggest that reducing harmful or polarizing content can negatively affect engagement metrics.

**Risk Judgement**  
Engagement-optimized systems structurally favor emotional, divisive, or sensational content.

**Human Impact**
Misinformation spread, polarization, and social unrest.

---

## 4. API & Data Exposure Risk

**Observation**  
Complex APIs and third-party integrations expand attack surfaces, increasing scraping and breach risks.

**Risk Judgement**  
System complexity increases long-term security fragility.

**Human Impact**
Recurring large-scale data leaks.

---

## 5. Dark Pattern Privacy Design

**Observation**  
Privacy controls are often fragmented and difficult to fully disable.

**Risk Judgement**  
Complexity functions as a behavioral barrier, not an accident.

**Human Impact**
Illusion of control over personal data.

---

## 6. Psychological Manipulation Capability

**Observation**  
Internal and external research has shown that feed ranking can influence mood and behavior.

**Risk Judgement**  
Large-scale emotional steering is possible in centralized social systems.

**Human Impact**
Mental health degradation and belief manipulation.

---

## 7. Predictive Profiling & Deepfake Risk

**Observation**  
Behavioral data enables predictive modeling and synthetic media generation.

**Risk Judgement**  
Identity misuse risk increases exponentially after data leaks.

**Human Impact**
Fraud, blackmail, and reputational harm.

---

## 8. National & Societal Risk (India Context)

**Observation**  
Large volumes of Indian user data are processed by foreign-owned platforms.

**Risk Judgement**  
Narrative control and algorithmic amplification can impact social stability.

**Human Impact**
Erosion of digital sovereignty and trust.

---

## Final AEJ Verdict

Facebook is not merely a social network.  
It is a large-scale behavioral infrastructure.

The core risk is not intent —  
it is concentration of data, power, and incentives.

---

## AEJ Takeaways

- Centralization amplifies harm
- Engagement ≠ societal value
- Data permanence is the new privacy failure
- Psychological cost must be treated as an engineering metric

> When a system knows you better than you know yourself,  
> control silently changes hands.
